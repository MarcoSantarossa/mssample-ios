mssample-ios is an iOS app showcase built using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

I'm not going to introduce anything new to the community but just put together all the pieces of the puzzle and apply the concept to an iOS application.

### App

It's the main project of the app and contains the skeleton of our iOS app which orchestrates all the modules.

### Core (+Mock)

The module `Core` provides the main functionalities of the app which must be used by all the vertical modules.
We have also a `CoreMock` to contain the [test doubles](https://marcosantadev.com/test-doubles-swift/) classes of `Core`.

### Album (Vertical module)

The module `Album` is a vertical module and provides the implementation for the feature photo collection and photo details views. It uses `Core` for main functionalities like `UIKit` extensions and networking.

Each module should expose a public router to allow the app to orchestrate the routing.
